### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- **How to use Grids for complex layouts**
- **How to build mobo-first website**
- **How to use predefined variables for constant styles**
- **How to use different and other shorthand properties of grid css**

#

**Following are the most useful and challenging code snippets where I learned the most**

The grid-template-area and grid-area properties:

```css
.wrapper {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "item-1 item-1 item-2"
    "item-3 item-3 item-3"
    "item-5 item-4 item-4";
}
```

### Continued development

Definitely going to use the grid shorthand properties going forward it really makes it really easy and understandable.
