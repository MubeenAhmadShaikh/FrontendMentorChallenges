Tried implementing both flex and grid to use for proper layouts.

## Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for better understanding on flexbox and its all the propereties. I really liked this and will refer it going forward.
- [CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/) - This is a greate website for beginners to learn the Grid which helped me finally understand the layouts, spacing and how we can use it for responsive website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) - This is really useful for comparing the results and adjusting the final output according to the design.
